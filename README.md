Description: 
This is a deck which covers the topics from inorganic chemistry for 11th and 12th grade students who study chemistry through the NCERT books
This is mostly for students preparing for the JEE, NEET, etc  entrance examinations conducted in India 
So if your goal is to study Inorganic Chemistry in general, please look elsewhere as this is for a specfic set of people only

If you find any errors, other than spelling mistakes, or some grammatical errors(which are in place in order to defer the user from guessing the answer without reading the question);
errors such as : factual and conceptual errors, etc
